          <p className="w-[80rem] mt-10 font-semibold text-xl">The conference revolves around bringing mathematics, physics and chemistry research areas synchronically on an indivisible 
            platform. This conference is an opportunity for collaborative research from various fields to share research findings and 
            latest ideas. The main intention of this conference is to integrate interdisciplinary inquiry to deliver the best applications. 
            Attending this conference will help participants sharpen their skills and refine their ideas as well as approaches by meeting 
            with their peers and counterparts. They will also have the chance to meet experts and high-level delegates, along with share 
            ideas and research findings from past and present. Participants can build new networks to meet different personalities and learn 
            about the latest tools available. The conference language is English. Original and unpublished works are encouraged for 
            presentation in the conference. The thrust areas include (but are not limited to) the following:
